Moses recounts organizing the new work gang and proving himself as a gang boss, dealing with a variety of cargo.

He talks about working for various companies on the piers, including Trist and Jarka, and discusses being made a gang boss.



In 1922, the International Longshoremenâ€™s Association (ILA) established a union in Philadelphia, but the International Workers of the World (IWW) was already in Philadelphia. Moses and ten others were in the ILA and worked for Jarka but they could not tell anyone that they were in the ILA because the IWW was so strong. Many shipping companies â€œblackballedâ€ the IWW; so Moses and the other ILA members tried to get a local charter but they needed someone to talk to the owner of the Marley Steamship Company. Paul â€œPollyâ€ Baker was the president of the local IWW, but when companies &quot;blackballed&quot; the IWW, he went to work for the Atlantic Refinery. Moses and the other ILA members recruited Baker to talk to the Marley Steamship owners and try to get a local charter for the ILA. He was successful in establishing the local ILA charter, number 1116.



Moses recalls working as a seventeen-year-old stowing rosin on ships, and packing cotton for shipment at cotton mills in Mobile, Alabama. </description><rel /><transcript>﻿MOSES: Great.

KIRLIN: Well when was you born Mr. Moses?

MOSES: Huh?

KIRLIN: What year was you born again?

MOSES: Why, ‘86, 1886.

WILLIAMS: Alright, were you born here in Philadelphia?

MOSES: No, Alabama.

WILLIAMS: Alabama.

KIRLIN: Alabama

MOSES: Born in Alabama. Born and raised in Alabama.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: When did uh, when did you come to Pennsylvania?

MOSES: I came here in 1916.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm. 

MOSES: Philadelphia.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

KIRLIN: How old were you then?

MOSES: Well I was in my young, hah, prime of life then, you know.

WILLIAMS: Yeah?

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: And what was --

MOSES: And, and I, I worked for a contractor. When they built Pier 98…

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: …and 96. And across there, I stripped all of them bridges, and that
railing, up-, upper loft there, I put all that up there. Now that is, the men
did, I was walking boss at that time.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: See?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm. 

MOSES: And, uh, so I worked for Trist ‘til we got those pillars just about
completed. And uhm, then, kind of warm to me, I don&#039;t know how about y’all.

KIRLIN: Yeah, it is. WILLIAMS: Yeah, it is.

MOSES: Then we, Trist began to lay off all the high-paid men. So the
superintendent said to me, he said, &quot;Moses,&quot; I said, &quot;Yes Mr. Schafer, what is
it?&quot; He said, “Look, I&#039;m going to keep you here to load all this material.
Pile-driving machine and all that stuff. We&#039;re going to send it up in Nova
Scotia. Got a big job up there. I&#039;m going to send you up there when you&#039;re done
doing this.&quot; I said, “Oh, no,” I said, uh, &quot;I go up there and I&#039;d freeze to
death before I get there good.&quot; And I said, &quot;That wouldn&#039;t do me.&quot; &quot;Oh, well,
we, we still would pay you more than you’re gettin&#039; now.&quot; And said, &quot;We, your,
your, your transportation up and down, but we, it wouldn&#039;t cost you nothing.
We’ll cover that. We want you to go up there and, and be general boss.&quot;
[Laughs] I, I said, &quot;Well I, I thank you very much,&quot; but I says, uh, &quot;I [laughs]
I&#039;m pretty well satisfied here for the time being. Of course when I&#039;m done with
you I realize I won&#039;t have a job.&quot; So he says, &quot;Well, your, your pay don&#039;t stop
if you will go.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I, I thank you very much.  But I believe I can
find something.&quot; “Okay.” I sat around for a week or so, you know, after I
got done, picking up all of that stuff, you know. They let all the other
high-paid men go. See? And they kept me. And my pay wasn&#039;t high as the other
men, but it was up there pretty good at that time.

WILLIAMS: Do you remember what it was?

MOSES: So, I go down to wharf. Walking on Delaware Avenue. I said a, a fellow
was standing there where the bus generally stopped. So he says to me, &quot;Hey
fellow, you want a job?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I says, &quot;I ain&#039;t got none.” And I said,
“I&#039;ll have to do something to meet ends.&quot; “Go over there to that Pier 48.”
Looming ship on both sides. “Go in and go aboard the ship. Go down in the ship
hold and help the, put that flour away there.” I went on over there. Well I
worked in the ship hold in Mobile, but wasn&#039;t doing that kind of work, you know.

WILLIAMS: Uh-huh. 

MOSES: Down there we had a lot of rosin and stuff, you know, see.

WILLIAMS: A lot of what?

MOSES: Rosin.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah. They store that, you know. Well I knew about that, but come down to
general cargo, I didn’t know nothing about that, you know what I mean.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So, I goes down there. So, I worked the rest of that day, and I asked him
how much pay did I go.  “Well you&#039;ll make a full day&#039;s pay.” He sent me in
there about ten o&#039;clock. Said, “Your pay will be a full day&#039;s pay.” That
wasn&#039;t but about, about six dollars and something at that time.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Well, come back the next day, they put me in there again. So, I made
about three days on this ship, this particular ship, an outsider, never been
there before.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So they had a ship out in the stream, they had one in 55, they had one in
56, and they had one at Pier 40. Oh, they had a lot of work. So I&#039;m down in the
ship hold, you know, and, in that time, you know, this particular man, he says,
“Hey you, fellow there. What&#039;s your name?&quot; I told him. &quot;Come on up here.&quot; I
climbed up the ladder, went up there. &quot;Get over there and take that pole there.&quot;
I says, uh, “Stevie, I don&#039;t know nothing.&quot; “That&#039;s all right get a hold to
it. I&#039;ll, I&#039;ll give you an idea. I&#039;ll tell you what to do.” I got a hold of
it. Said, “All right. Put two or three turns on the head.” And a fellow was
there turning on the steam. The hawser was going. Old En-, old English hawser.
And then he says, &quot;All right bring your load up.&quot; I started coming up with it,
you know, [Mumbles] got up the step, and he said, “Now put your hand on top of
the pole there and stop, stop it. And hold the lead in your hand.” And the
other fellow that had the strikeout pole, he, away he went with his load. He
said, “Now slide it away to him.” He stood there about fifteen minutes
schooling me, you know. I didn&#039;t know nothing about it. Finally he told, told
the man that was tending the bridge, he said, “Watch him and help him out
there.” Said, “He&#039;ll be all right.” And, uh, all right, I missed the day
at that, you know. Come back the next day and I&#039;m an outsider, you know?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: See a big gang of men at the door, at the gateway. Say, “Come on
fellow. You were in there yesterday. Come on in.” I come in. “Go back to
that same job where you was yesterday.” So, I knocked around there. And I come
to be a superman, you know, just one of them fellows that was just made for the business.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: -because I, I, I was a quick catch up.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Quick to learn.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: I caught on pretty good.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And then they, they had a man there who was a good hook-thrower.  I was
standing on the deck one day watching him, and he said, I says, “Hey,” I
says, “I can do that.” He says, &quot;You think so?&quot; I say, &quot;Yeah, what will stop
me?&quot; &quot;Yeah, all right. Come over and try your hand.&quot; Now the big boss, I didn&#039;t
know he was on the ship. And a load come up. And I was poled out of that. Bam!
I caught it. The fellow who got the strikeout poll, he went with the load, and
come back, and the big guy was standing in there, all the way look, watching. I
don&#039;t know he was around. I thought he was on the dock somewhere. So he come on
over. He says, &quot;Hey,” said, “Take care of him, learn him how. He&#039;ll make a
good one.&quot; Now I didn&#039;t know he was, I, [Laughs] I thought he was going to kick
at me trying to do it.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: But he was willing for me to do it and wanted me to learn, and he told
this guy, says, &quot;Help him to learn. Show him how. Take care of him. He&#039;ll make a
good one.&quot; So I got to where, when the vessels was coming in there, they would
take in so many, they used to call them s-sailor men, so many to rig the hatches
and get it ready for the ship to work. But it, he, doorway where a hatch was
going to be. “Come on Moses get in there with them. Help get that gear
together.” So I worked there for a long while. And, uh, used to load the grain
for them, you know, whenever the grain floater would come in,

WILLIAMS: Yep.

MOSES: -alongside the ship, you know and then load the grain. Well, maybe they
would load the lower, they’d fill the lower hold up about, I&#039;d say two-thirds
full or maybe a little better than half. Now they&#039;re going to put general cargo
on top of that now, for storage, you know what I mean. So, uh, they&#039;d went on
with that, and finally--And in 1922, Jarka come in here. And a fellow drove a
little kind of a bell, bell truck from Buffalo, New York, because Jarka was big
up there you know, already, but they was never in Philadelphia. And that was the
first time to appear in Philadelphia. That was 1922. So, all right. I worked a
while along with the Atlantic Transport Company. And Jarka had so much work you know

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: -and the transport company would have a boat maybe once a week, maybe in
that time. So I said, “Well,” I said, “I&#039;ll go where the work’s at.
There&#039;s no use me standing around here.  I can go over there at that other
outfit and make a good living, because I can at least get three or four days a
week, ya know?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: -maybe more

WILLIAMS: Right.

MOSES: -then include some time at night, you know, too.”

WILLIAMS: That’s with Jarka?

MOSES: Jarka.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So I started in for Jarka, so I worked for Jarka oh, I imagine about
four, three or four years. And, uh, I was working with a fellow by the name of
Dave Simmon at that time.  I guess you all hear that he died some years ago, but
he was a foreman for Jarka. So in those days, they, like if the, a company would
have a lot of work, and they had so many foremen, they would tell each foremen
to take a extra gang, you know. Now they would pay a, a foreman wages for that
gang, but the regular gang boss had to be responsible for them, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And they would tell the foreman, says, “Take your gangway man, and put
him down as boss, and we&#039;ll pay boss pay to him, but you supervise both gangs.&quot;
They used to do that in them days

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: see. And so, they done, one day McNamara and Mr. Dugan come on the ship
where I was working, said, “Moses?&quot; “Yes sir, Captain, what is it?&quot; &quot;We are
going to make a gang boss out of you.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; I say, &quot;Captain, a gang boss?&quot; I
said, &quot;I, I&#039;m,&quot; I said, &quot;Captain, I&#039;m doing all right where I&#039;m at. I&#039;m working
the best gang you&#039;ve got. And I&#039;m sure of at least from three days a week or
more. And that way I can make a living. But if I take your gang, start out
there, I don&#039;t make good, you&#039;ll drop me. I ain&#039;t got nary another limb to light
on.&quot; And I said, &quot;The foreman will take another union man in my place, and I
won&#039;t have nowhere to go.&quot; And I said, &quot;Then what will I do for the Americans
till then?&quot;

WILLIAMS: [Laughs] Right.

MOSES: So, he said, “Oh,” he said, uh, “You, uhm, you ought to be able to
get a gang together in about, I&#039;ll say, I&#039;ll say three weeks to a month.”
“Oh,” I said. Well now I know, I know now I was a dead cat on the line. So
he said to me, “How long do you think that it would take you to get a good
gang together.” I said, “About 10 minutes.”

WILLIAMS: [Laughs]

MOSES: “You mean to tell me you, you could go out there, you could hire a gang
of men, and it’d be sufficiently to get producement, and stow the cargo
correct, and all of that.” I said, “Why certainly.” I said, “You know
why?” I say, “I know everybody from Pier 1 to 179 East Port Richmond.” I
said, “Now you send me out there to work.” I said, uh, “I&#039;d be a dumb man
to start with, to go out there and hire men that wasn&#039;t going to do your
work.” Said, “That&#039;d be a lost cat right there.”

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: He says, “Well.” I said, “I&#039;ll tell you something else.” I said,
“Now, you put me out there for Foreman all right. Now if you&#039;ve got, oh,
dirty, nasty work or something or other like that, you&#039;ll give me that. But
carting clean freight, steel, that kind of work, you are going to give that to
your, the other fellows.” He said, “You mean to tell me that you could, you
could handle steel?” I said, “You put that in the ship?” “Did you put
that in the ship?” I said, “When I was foreman, yes. Anything that&#039;s
shipped, heck, I can put it in there. It don&#039;t make a difference what it is.”
“Well, okay. I’ll tell you what you do.” I say, “I&#039;m listening.” “Go
on up by the hall, put a little news out, and, uh, we&#039;re going to start you at
one o&#039;clock at Pier 40.” “All right.” So I go in the office. I&#039;m the first
man, first foreman they give a ticket to. I&#039;m the new man just starting.

WILLIAMS: Right.

MOSES: First man, he goes, says, “Here you are, Moses.” And he give me
twenty, twenty-one tickets, or twenty-two.  Well I don’t know what it was now.
So I goes out and begin to hire the gang. Well I had give out about three or
four tickets, and Mike Coral walked up to me and said, said, “Hey Moses.&quot; I
said, “Yeah Mike, what is it?&quot; Said, &quot;I hear you’re hiring for Pier 40.&quot;
“Oh,” I said, “Well that, that’s what the man --” And he said, “Well
we’re working that ship.” But they had had some trouble there. They had been
called to this ship, oh, on account of weather conditions, and they didn&#039;t, and,
and they hadn&#039;t been allowed no pay for that time that they&#039;d been ordered up
and down to come to the ship, and so they refused to work for that reason. And
they was waiting for conditions.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And, uh, I says, “All right, Mike.” I said, “Hey boys,” I said,
“You fellows that I give them, bring them back.” They brought them back and
gave them to me.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: I took them, put them together, and I walked in, back in the office. I
said, “Hey Cap.” I said “Now, you’re starting me off wrong already.”

WILLIAMS: No kidding [laughs]

MOSES: I said, uh, “You tell me hire for Pier 40.” I said, “My brothers is
working that ship.  I pushed my cap up. I said, “You see that?” I said, uh,
“I belong to the ILA.” [International Longshoremen&#039;s Association] And I
said, “They are my brothers working that ship. They’re ILA men, you hired. I
can&#039;t work that ship.”

WILLIAMS: What, what year was this?

MOSES: So --oh, I just forget now.

WILLIAMS: Ok.

MOSES: But anyway-

WILLIAMS: That’s fine.

MOSES: -he says, “All right. I tell you what you do.” I say, “What’s
that?” “Hire the gang, and take them down to Pier 78.” I says, “Anybody
been working on that ship and been knocked off?” &quot;Oh, no, no, no. That ship
had is just arriving.&quot; That&#039;s all right. I go out and I hire the gang, and they
had this truck there, and he sent me down to 78. I get down to 78. Well you know
they had been working green folks there, you know. Somebody know what they&#039;ve
done. The track was all full of cargo, stuff where they had let it, uh, put in
the upper loft, you know and it fell down there, you know and the customhouse
fellows was there checking the damage and all that stuff. So this ship pulled in
finally, and docked. And uh, uh Saint Harry Hines, I don&#039;t know if you all know
him or not, but he was the supervisor, you know, the, the ship board.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: He told me, he said, “Moses?” I said, “Yes.” He says, uh, “Put
your gang in number three. That&#039;s the heavy hatch.” All right. I goes in there
and I starts, and that&#039;s one o&#039;clock on a Saturday. He says, “Work until
Sunday morning.” I says, uh, “Captain,” I says “Maybe, maybe the men
won&#039;t have, uh, provisions to get food with. &quot;Well what you mean?&quot; I said,
&quot;Well, if you&#039;re going to work from now until tomorrow morning, that would be a
long time.&quot; And I said, &quot;Those men will have to eat.&quot; He run his hand in his
pocket, and he gave me fifty dollars. Said “Here,” said “Take this, and
you can buy all of them food when they knock off at mealtime.&quot; So, all right, we
work until six o&#039;clock, knock off, to get, from 98 there, to get something to
eat. So I walked into the restaurant, and everybody was eating but two men. They
didn&#039;t have nothing, so I said, “All right, you call for something or other,
and, and I&#039;ll pay for it.” I&#039;ve got fifty dollars of the company&#039;s money, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And all I had to do was to take care of them two men. Everybody else had
enough money to buy their own food. And I bought those two men supper at
midnight, eat, and we knock off the next morning. And I think I spent about not
over eight dollars of that fifty dollars.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: See? Because every, everybody was okay, you know. Everybody had money to
buy their, their food. Well, I said, “I ain’t got to buy them nothing.”

WILLIAMS: Right.

MOSES:  I don&#039;t tell them I&#039;ve got fifty dollars, or nothing like that. I don&#039;t
be that dumb.

WILLIAMS: [Laughs] Um-hm.

MOSES: No, no. So they sent a gang down to release me on the Sunday morning.
They told me to come back Sunday night and take over again. I went back same as
was loaded with Clorox [?] from the top to the lower hold. So I go back [Laughs]
Sunday night, and I work until eight o&#039;clock Monday morning, finishing up the
hatch. That was, that was my first starting out.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So they give me so much work until [Laughs] I, I, I, I didn&#039;t know
whether I was coming or going. But I had a good gang. And they made producement
off me.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Well, every, every job they put me on, I give a good producement on this job.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And when that, work out that ship, soon as another one would arrive,
they&#039;d send me right on that one. One of the fellows that had been on hand for a
long while, he went in, and he said to Mitchell, he says, “Hey you&#039;re giving
the new gang all the money, all the, all the work that they, they can make
money.” He says, ”Well,” said, “We are getting producement off of the
man.” And he said, “Why wouldn&#039;t we give him work?” Said, “He gives
satisfaction. The company’s well pleased with him. That&#039;s how, that&#039;s, that&#039;s
how he gets the work. And when you learn to hire men that can work and do work,
then we’ll give you work too.” Said, “I can do as much work as he can.”
Say, “Yeah?” Said, “Well now, look. I&#039;ll find that out.” He said,
“We&#039;ve got a ship going to be up at Port Richmond tomorrow morning. This ship
has only four hatches. And it&#039;s loaded from stem to stern with sugar, fine
sugar.” Said, “We’re going to send Moses up there, and will send you out
there too. Moses will work the forward end. You work the aft end of the ship.”
All right. I don&#039;t, I don&#039;t know this. You know, see I don&#039;t know nothing about
this, you know.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: So this fellow go up there. Well now I got the forward. Naturally I
ain’t got no long haul, understand? Well they sent up an extra tow motor
driver to help out this stern part of the ship who had to go a long ways to the
bumper, so, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: While the men, the men kicked on to tow motor drivers coming into the
cars. So then this fellow just drove his tow motor aside. He was just sitting
there reading the papers, you know, and all that stuff, you know. So I happened
to come out on the dock. He&#039;s sitting up there. I says, “Look-a here.” I
said, “What are you supposed to do?” I asked him. “Well I come up to help
Houston out, but the, the men don&#039;t want no two drivers coming in.” Of course
I don&#039;t blame them. I wouldn&#039;t want that, I wouldn’t want no two coming in on
me either. I said, “Well, look,” I said, “Now, I&#039;m going to put you to
work.” Said, “You’re sitting up there burning up the gas, gasoline, and
ain&#039;t doing nothing.” I said, “See my cars over there?” He said,
“Yeah.” I said, “Every time them carmen push an empty truck like that, you
get it.” And I went to my driver, I said, “Hey, you pull your load, and as
soon as you cut loose, when, go right back there.” He said, “Well what about
the emptying?” “Don&#039;t worry about the empty. When you cut loose your load,
make it back to the hatch. Be ready to catch the next load when it comes out.”
And this fellow pulled the empty trailers all day long. I done twelve, fourteen,
and some, some hours fifteen hundred bags of sugar is regularly taked on the
wall. So, the next morning --now if he&#039;d have, if he&#039;d have said to me what he
said to that boy, I&#039;d have picked up my coat and told him to take the gang and goodbye.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: He never would&#039;ve said that to me. Man he talked to that fellow like a
dog that morning. But this fellow, now, if he&#039;d been smart, the play was, let me
know this, see? Now, I can slack down. 

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And he wouldn’t have said nothing to me because I can get it.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

MOSES: And that would allow me to not do so much more than he was doing.

KIRLIN: Yeah.

MOSES: And then that wouldn&#039;t have give him such a shot at him. But he don&#039;t
tell me nothing about this. And all this talk was unbeknownst to me. I know
nothing about it.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Mitchell come to me. I&#039;m putting the gang on the truck. “Hey, God
Almighty knows you, you tore up things up there yesterday.” I said, “Say it
again?” Said, “You run wild up there yesterday.” I said, “Well let me
know this. I didn&#039;t hurt nobody, did I?” “Oh no, I don&#039;t mean that. You done
so much work.” I said, “Ain’t that what you sent me up there to do?”
“Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep the good work up. Keep the good work
up.” [Laughs] He walked away from me. Now I could&#039;ve slacked down, done about
nine hundred bags an hour, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: -with him doing about seven or eight, and he wouldn&#039;t have looked so bad
against me

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: but he&#039;s doing eight hundred bags an hour, and I&#039;m doing twelve and
fifteen. Well, oh well, the man can know there&#039;s something wrong there.

WILLIAMS: I know.

MOSES: He wasn&#039;t, he wasn’t ready for it. And if he just had of let me know
it, I could&#039;ve saved him.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: Yeah. You know, but I always, all of my life, I was always anxious to be
a help to anybody any way that I could.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: You know. And right now you can go down there and, and speak of little
Moses, and there’s a few men down there was around when I left.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And they know me. And I met Henry Bolak. You know him?

WILLIAMS: Yes I do.

MOSES: The other day. And he used to work under me too.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: I was down at Sixth and Market one day. I went down to, uh,
Snellenburg’s to pay little bill I have a charging card down there. So I went
down to pay them on the little bill I had. And when I come out and walked from
the corner, who run over to me but Henry Bolak.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: He was awful glad to see me. Uh, he said, “Moses,” he said, “You,
see, I worked with you a lot and you was, you was ever so good.” Said, “You
was always a decent man.” And he says, “They, them that know about you still
talk about you. And I&#039;ve been away from there twenty-four years.”

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: I&#039;ve been left there twenty-four years. Yep.

WILLIAMS: You were the first one they said for us to see. They said-

MOSES: So, and I wasn&#039;t, go to Mr. Owens when he was living, since I retired,
like it&#039;s snow on the ground, people didn’t have a shovel to move the snow. I,
I got two sea shovels down there. I go to Mr. Owens. I say, “Hey Captain
Owens.” “Yes Moses. What is it?” I said, “I&#039;d like to have a shovel. I
got, I got to move snow.” “All right, go back there and get one.” I go
back there and maybe they got three or four bunch. I take my knife and cut, cut
the twine loose, and take a brand-new one, but I put in my car and come on home.
Didn&#039;t cost me nothing. They&#039;d give it to me. And, and say, say, I go there and
say, “I want it.” Say, “All right. Go back there and get it.”

KIRLIN: Who was, who was Mr. Owens? He worked for the company?

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Uh-huh.

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: For Jarka?

MOSES: Yeah. That&#039;s when they gera, gera  give, give, give places in Philly. I
understand it&#039;s in Camden now.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: I don&#039;t know. But they tell me it&#039;s in Camden now. But it used to be down
there on Delaware Avenue. 

KIRLIN: Let me, let me ask you, Moses, what, when did you first join a union?
How did that work? What, have the unions changed a little bit, I think. I don&#039;t
know. When did, when did you first join a union?

MOSES: Oh.

KIRLIN: How did that work?

MOSES: Well, ILA came on in 1922. You see the IWW was a union that was here at
that time.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

MOSES: And they run into some trouble you know, and the company blackballed
them. And they lost the charter.

KIRLIN: Was you working for IWW too?

MOSES: Yeah Jarka was here then. And then, all right. Now, myself and nine, and
nine more men, ten of us, we had the ILA together for a long while, but we
couldn&#039;t say nothing about it you know, because the IWW was too strong. [?] a
quarter. And we used to meet 17th and South. Up over the Army store. The ILA did.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So after the companies blackballed the IWWs --

WILLIAMS: All the companies or just Jarka?

MOSES: Yeah. Yeah.

WILLIAMS: All the companies?

MOSES: All of them.

WILLIAMS: Yeah. 

MOSES: Now, this was an open shop,  the third biggest port in the country,

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: with no union.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Dan Jones, Herschel Chester, Ben Bragston, Ben Parrymore, George
Moncastle. Now all of them was old time stevedores. And we all belonged to that,
to that ILA at that time. And the question come up, up in the meeting, I was
there. They said, “Well, we can get a charter and get on the footing, but
somebody got to meet the- steamship owner.” Now, we got to, got to be
something up here to meet them people, you know?

WILLIAMS: That’s right.

MOSES: So Vebrook [?] says, “Well, who&#039;s qualified to go? Somebody will have
to go.” So, George Moncastle said, “I&#039;ll tell you what we’ll do.” Say,
“What?” “Go down to the Atlantic Refinery and get Polly Baker.” Polly
Baker had the IWW. And Polly, after they blackballed the IWW, Polly Baker went
down to the Atlantic Refinery and worked in the barrel gang. Polly Baker was, at
that time. Somebody said, “Well, if you do that, then the colored executives
won&#039;t have a chance.” Said, “Well, you&#039;ve got to get somebody that&#039;s
qualified to --“

[Break in Recording]

MOSES: Big bloke went down the Atlantic Refinery, got Polly Baker, brought Polly
Baker right over to 17th and the South the next night. And they told him that we
could get the charter here for the ILA if, uh, he goes to the steamship owners.
Polly said, “Yes, I&#039;ll do, I’ll do it.” Polly Baker went, and we had the
port the next morning-

WILLIAMS: Hm.

MOSES: -the ILA.

KIRLIN: So you had an old IWW guy --

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Go-

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Go-

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: and represent you. And-

MOSES: Yeah. Yeah. The ILA come whole footed the following morning behind Polly Baker.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Well Polly Baker knows what to do when he go before the steamship owner,
because he had that, he had the IWW.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah. He was president of that, you know, and was running the port at
that time.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah. So, now, the ILA charter number, of course you may not know that,
you may hear somebody say it, but you won&#039;t hear nobody say that, uh, that they
don&#039;t know it, but I know it. This number that you&#039;re working under now ain’t
no 1291 either.

WILLIAMS: It&#039;s not?

MOSES: No sir.

WILLIAMS: Well, tell us.

MOSES: The number, the charter number of the ILA is, uh, Eleven hundred and
sixteen. That&#039;s the number of the ILA. But the PM&amp;T [sic -- PMTA] didn&#039;t have the authority
that they got today, you know. PM&amp;T [PMTA] run the union now. And it won’t never be
broke no more, because when you work, dues is paid. All you got to do is just
work. You don&#039;t have to pay no due. That due was took out before you get the money.

WILLIAMS: Right.

MOSES: Now, and see --

WILLIAMS: It used to be different?

MOSES: Yeah. But the union officials, they, they were walking around, pay no
capital or tax, and [?] first thing, first thing you know, there was no money in
the treasury, and the union was about to drop through.

WILLIAMS: When was that? When?

KIRLIN: When was that?

MOSES: Oh, that was about, uh, about twenty years ago. PM&amp;T [PMTA] stepped in. They
took over, see? So they pay off all of the union officials and everybody. PM&amp;T [PMTA]
does. So you can&#039;t never be, you, you, you can&#039;t work now and be no two or three
years back in your dues.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: That won&#039;t happen no more.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

WILLIAMS: So dues withholding is a new thing?

MOSES: Yeah. The money for dues, if you owe dues, and you work, so much money
is, is took from that before you’re paid.

WILLIAMS: And that happened only twenty years ago?

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Twenty years ago?

MOSES: Right.

WILLIAMS: That recently?

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Hm.

MOSES: So this, this, this outfit is one of the richest things in the country. PM&amp;T. [PMTA]

KIRLIN: PMTA? [PMTA]

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Yeah.

MOSES: T. See, I know that.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So much money to, to the president and wanted to borrow so much of it.

WILLIAMS: [Laughter]

KIRLIN: [Laughter]

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: [Laughter] He did!

KIRLIN: Yeah. Yeah.

MOSES: And, and they ain’t got nothing but some money,

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: see. Well you see if the men work. Never nobody work now, and be back in
dues. Uhn-uh. Not no more.

KIRLIN: When, when you worked for IWW, did you have to pay dues then?

MOSES: Oh, you paid dues, but the-

KIRLIN: a-

MOSES:  -the union officials was, you know the colored fellows was running it then.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: You know. They-

KIRLIN: They was running the IWW? 

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Whose, who, any names you remember?

MOSES: Yeah. That&#039;s right.

KIRLIN: Any names you remember from the IWW days?

MOSES: Huh?

KIRLIN: Any, anybody&#039;s name that you remember from the IWW days?

MOSES: Well, all of them dead now, all the officials.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

MOSES: You see there was a fellow named Herschel Chastain. He was one of the
headman in the IWW. There was another by the name of George Moncastle. Now all
of them fellows, all of them names I&#039;m calling was officials in this IWW union.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Ben Parrymore was another one. That was a heavy man in there, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Well all of them was heavy officials, you know.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: Had authorities, delegate and presidents and all of that.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

MOSES: Trustees and all of that stuff, you know. But it’s altogether different
of today, see. It&#039;s not no kind of way as it were in those days.

KIRLIN: And --

WILLIAMS: Well how was it different? How was it different then?

MOSES: Eh. The work of the day as a longshoreman. Okay. All the work, all the
cargo comes panelized, you know, mostly.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Well, all right, you don&#039;t ever need but about four men down in the hold
to put a chalk under there when the chisel was carried over there and set it
down. You didn&#039;t have to do nothing like that in those days. You, because you
took it piece by piece and traveled with it and stowed it, and all that, and
would take, yeah, it would take about twelve men, I would say, and of today, you
don&#039;t need nothing like that.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Now, they got ships now don&#039;t even need deckmen. You know that?

KIRLIN: Um-hm. Yup.

MOSES: Don&#039;t even need deckmen. And I told some of the fellows in ‘57 just a
few days before I left there, uh, like you hire three deckmen now. Okay. And
another company working. Okay. You get together and they start off. And one man
would come in the helm, and he&#039;d run until twelve o&#039;clock. Now the other two,
God in Heaven know where they were, they were working for somebody else. And yet
they check on there. See?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So now maybe you are working in one part. And maybe you need the, the d-,
the [d.?] topped up. Now you got to call some of the wharfmen or couple of the
old men to help that one deckman change his hat. The other, your other, your
other two deckhands, you, you don&#039;t know where they is.

KIRLIN: Gone.

MOSES: Well, the, the, the one up there know where they was, but you would never
know, see?

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: So I said, I told one of them, I said, “Look,” I said, “Let me tell
you fellows some time, I ain’t gonna be here much longer.” I said “But
I&#039;ll tell you one thing.” I says, “There&#039;s gonna come a time when they ain&#039;t
gonna need nary one of y’all.” “Old man, you can&#039;t work without
deckmen.” Mh.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: I says, a pencil is something. And I said, “Some people that got that
money, they’re gonna make money, believe it or not, regardless of what you
think or do.” And I said, “You&#039;ll go along for a while, but in time, they&#039;ll
beat you.” And it happened. It happened. What they do now, they, they, they
can bring, bring a ship in here now, and all they do is take off the tarpaulin
spread. They&#039;d hook a fork back there. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  They
gonna have a pontoon going right on back there. And set up. They&#039;ve got to light
that and drop it over there and lock it. See, they don&#039;t need nobody to take
them off now.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Ship take them off itself. That’s right.

KIRLIN: That’s covers.

MOSES: See I, see I, see I know all of that.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Because I come through it.

KIRLIN: Let me ask you this Moses. Think about it a little bit. But what was the
hardest day you had down there, like the, the hardest, dirtiest work that you
had? That --

MOSES: Well I&#039;ll tell you.

KIRLIN: Des-

MOSES: -Now, I know a --

KIRLIN: Describe it a little bit for us.

MOSES: All I know is to put it this way. Black damp is something else. It weighs
about four hundred pound to the bag. See? Now that, that&#039;s hard work, see? Well
in them time, used to, like, like a pallet load of it come down right here,
maybe there’s about twelve bags of it on a pallet, and maybe you&#039;ve got to go
from here to that wall or further with it. Well, you ain’t got no chisel down
there to pick that up and carry it back there. A pair of men carry a bag there,
and another pair carry it there, and another pair carry it there. And when they
get back to the tear, then the, them last two men got to help them two top it.
That&#039;s hard work. That&#039;s, that’s hard work, because it would be four hundred
pounds in a bag. Yeah.

KIRLIN: What was in them bags?

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: What was in it? What was in the --

MOSES: Black damp. 

KIRLIN: Black damp?

MOSES: Yeah. 

KIRLIN: What was that? Some kind of --

MOSES: Some kind of a stuff, you know, that you used for putting in, oh, uh,
cement and stuff, you know.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

MOSES: Um-hm. 

WILLIAMS: Asphalt?

MOSES: Yeah. Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Yes?

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: In bags?

MOSES: Um-hm. Yeah. See I know all of that.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Why did the IWW get blackballed?

MOSES: Well, well they wouldn&#039;t do that. If you told one of them something, they
didn&#039;t like it, you know what they’d do? They&#039;d run the load about halfway up,
and cut the steam off and walk off the ship. That&#039;s right. That&#039;s what they
would do.

WILLIAMS: And that went on for ten years?

MOSES: That&#039;s right. That&#039;s right. I had the same holler, “Yo.” [Claps]
That&#039;s it. Everybody walking off the, off the ship, and out the pier, and going
home. Yeah. So I come through all of that, see? And I know what I&#039;m talking
about. That&#039;s right. Yeah. Now they, before, I used to have to do, uh, canned
goods. Well, now what I would do, the young men who could read fast, I would put
them on the dock. And the ageable fellows, I put them down the cellar. So the
[?] may have never seen no movement to them, but they could see the movement of
them youths out there, and they could move. That&#039;s right. Yeah. I&#039;d always make,
if, if I had to do canned goods, like American [?] come here loaded with canned
goods, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Say, “Captain Moses, How about me going with you?” “Well,” I
said, “I don&#039;t know yet. You know I have a regular gang. You know that, and if
all of them are here, then I will not have any room that I can take you. But if
any one of them is not present, I can take until I get enough. But I can&#039;t not
do it as long as the men that belong to this gang are present.”

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: So, “Okay Captain Moses. We’ll wait and see what happens.” Or maybe
I have a load that wouldn&#039;t take about three or four. Now I know who ain&#039;t
there. I&#039;d say, “Did some of y’all see so and so?” Said “No Captain. We
didn&#039;t know see him. I, I don&#039;t know whether he come in or not.” Yeah. So if
both captains said, “What you say Moses?” I&#039;d say, “I ain&#039;t saying
anything yet. I ain’t got quite enough yet.” “Well, what&#039;s the trouble?
Ain’t they all here?” I says, “No.” Says, “ Three or four light
yet.” “Well take anybody as long as you get a man.” Eh “I can’t take
anybody. I&#039;ve got to take somebody who can work. I won&#039;t take anybody. That will
never do.” Said, “Captain Moses? Can I go?” I said, “Can you read canned
goods?” “Yeah.” “Get on the truck.” I’d say, “How about you there
boy?” He said, “Yeah, Captain. I can, I can read.” “Get on the truck.”
I&#039;d be standing there. Now the first captain now he, he’d ask me, “What do
you say Moses?” I says, “I ain&#039;t said nothing yet. I, I, I’ll say when I
get enough on your, your truck.”

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And I&#039;m looking trying to see if I can peek out somebody qualified to go.
Couldn&#039;t, couldn’t just take anything, because that wouldn&#039;t work.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: I&#039;d say, um, “You, you like to work?” Said, “Yeah, yeah Mr. Moses,
I, I can work.” I said “Can you read?” He says, “Yeah.” “Get on the
truck.” I said, “That&#039;s it Captain.” [Laughs]

KIRLIN: [Laughs]

WILLIAMS: [Laughs]

MOSES: [Laughs] Yeah.

KIRLIN: Where-

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: -where did they do the hiring at?

MOSES: Well-

MOSES: -they used to do it down there at 55.

WILLIAMS: Uh-hm.

MOSES: Sometime over there at 48 and around there.

KIRLIN: Right at the pier gate?

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Right out front?

MOSES: Well, well they, they hire down at the, under the bridge now.

KIRLIN: Yeah.

MOSES: Um-hm. But in those days they always hired down at 55, fif-, I mean 53
and 48

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: For all the companies?

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: At the one spot?

MOSES: All companies hired right there.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Now, now --

WILLIAMS: Ev-, even up to Reading?

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Even, even up to Richmond?

MOSES: Now, Murphy and Cook, they always hired over there at Christian Street, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES:  Murphy and Cook.

KIRLIN: Um-hm.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: That was a standard old-time company, you know. And they, they was
settled over there at the foot of Christian Street.

KIRLIN: Well-

MOSES: -Well they always hired over there.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Well the Luvino Company generally hires over, a-around in there, and
until they went down under the bridge. Now, all companies hire down under the
bridge now. Nobody, now like, like you working in a gang, of course y’all know
that. And your gang is slated to go out, you just go where that gang is. You
don&#039;t bother about going down under the bridge, if, if you know your gang is
going up to Richmond, you just go on up to Richmond.

KIRLIN: See?

WILLIAMS: Right.

MOSES: That&#039;s the way, way they do it now.

KIRLIN: Yeah. How, and before though, how would you know where your gang’s
working, say, before, like they had the tape?

MOSES: Well, they had a board down there that they would write it on.

KIRLIN: Uh-huh.

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Down, down at the --

MOSES: They had a, had a blackboard and they’d, they’d write so-and-so-

KIRLIN: Yeah, I mean-

MOSES: -at Pier so-and-so. Foreman so-and-so at Pier so-and-so. So-and-so at
down at 98. And have it on the board. Now the guys that’d be working at night,
they’d drive around by there and look at the board. Then they&#039;d know to come
down that next morning.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And before I, before I was a regular foreman, when the streetcar used to
run on Walton Street here, it don&#039;t run there now.

WILLIAMS: No.

MOSES: I’d get on a car then, and say, “Hey Moses.” I&#039;d say, “Yeah.”
“I want to work with you today.” I said, “I ain’t got no job.” Say,
“Your name on the board.” Now they done, they done been by there overnight
and looked at it. And maybe I&#039;m home asleep. I don&#039;t know anything about it. [Laughs]

WILLIAMS: [Laughs]

MOSES: [Mumbles] I&#039;d say, “Well, let’s get down there, and when we get down
there, we&#039;ll see what happens.”

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Very interesting.

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: They’d try to get you before-

MOSES: Well-

KIRLIN: -they was trying to get you before the crowd, before the crunch.

MOSES: Yeah. Well you see, that, them fellows used to like to work with me, you
know. And they&#039;d make it their business that, I mean before I was a regular foreman.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And whenever they&#039;d see my name for a job, they&#039;d, they would hang right
around me until I get the amount of men I need. That&#039;s right. [Laughs] Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

MOSES: I never, I’ve seen, I&#039;ve seen fellows hiding, and seen guys take the
ticket away from them. I seen all that happen.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

KIRLIN: You mean, just took them right off them?

MOSES: Yeah. And I could, I could come out of the office with tickets to hire
for a gang, and walk out there.  Maybe a mob of men there, you know. I&#039;d hand
them the tickets. Just hand them the tickets. Nobody moved. Told everybody stand
at attention.  I&#039;d hand him a ticket. I&#039;d hand him a ticket. After a while,
“Hey, Mr. Moses, what do you say?” I&#039;d say, “Don&#039;t know yet. If I can take
you I will, but I first got to find out if I can take you.” Well, they treated
me with the most respect. They never, they never raced me at all, not at all. I
could walk out there and wouldn&#039;t be nobody in there, and just walk over to--
say, “So-and-so, you want to work?” Said, “Yeah, Captain.” Hand them a
ticket. I’d say, “How about you?” Said, “Well I&#039;ll go.” Hand them a
ticket, and just go on down the line.

KIRLIN: What do you need a ticket for? To get on the pier?

MOSES: Well for hiring.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: For, for the, for the day&#039;s work, see? You got a ticket, you go to the
pier, see? Can’t send you away because you&#039;re a union man, see?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: That&#039;s right.

KIRLIN: How&#039;d you get paid in them days?

MOSES: Well, the pay along at that time, eight hours was something like about,
s- about 7.95. Something like that. Yeah. And before then it was less. And as
time moved on, it’d gradually increased up, and up, and so forth and so on.
And every time they would have uh, a raise, like, like, uh, when a contract
would run out, and they’d renegotiate for another one, and they would gamble
for so much. Well, if they didn&#039;t get all of that, they would get a portion of it

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: They’d go on that way. Yeah.

KIRLIN: You get paid at the end of the week?

MOSES: Yeah. Yeah. Some paid on a Thursday. Some paid on a Saturday. Some paid
on a Friday. Most of ‘them paid on a Friday. Some paid on a Thursday. Yeah.

KIRLIN: Was there, was there any, uhm, times when there wasn&#039;t a lot of work?
When there was no work at all? You know?

MOSES: Well I seen times there wouldn&#039;t be a ship in sight and a sail to be
seen, as big a port as this is.

KIRLIN: When was that?

MOSES: Oh, it was roundabout 19-, well it happens now, as far as that goes.
Plenty of days there don&#039;t be nothing nowhere.

KIRLIN: What do you do?

MOSES: That&#039;s right.

KIRLIN: What do you do then?

MOSES: Go home [Laughs] and wait until something comes. That&#039;s what you do. Now
like, you’re a foreman. A company got a ship. Okay. Well you go out and you
work that, that ship. Or maybe another ship arrives. He goes on that ship. And
that&#039;s, that&#039;s the way they do it now. Yeah. Yeah. So all of them things works
out and now people that never come through wouldn&#039;t know nothing about it.

WILLIAMS: Right. Right.

MOSES: But men who come through it know all about it. All about it.

WILLIAMS: You said you worked in Alabama in Mobile?

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: On the docks-

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: -there?

MOSES: Yeah. I stowed rosin in the ships in Mobile.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm. That was, uh, how long? Ten years?

MOSES: Oh, well, maybe two barrels come down, and you&#039;ve got a bar there, you
know, see? Or maybe, maybe there&#039;s a place here, and maybe it&#039;s not long enough
to get that barrel in there. Well what you do, you make up that space. We had
cord with us up, you know, passed over it-

WILLIAMS: Um-hm. MOSES: -and bring another tear right on by, and then when you
come over it, why you fill it in with cordwood, you know, so nothing can&#039;t shift-

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: -you know, until you fill the hole right up. Yeah.

WILLIAMS: Was there a union in Mobile?

MOSES: Oh yeah.

WILLIAMS: There was?

MOSES: Didn&#039;t, well it wasn’t a, wasn&#039;t a, wasn&#039;t a union then. There now, the
union there now, but wasn&#039;t none there then.

WILLIAMS: Right.

MOSES: Yeah. And I, I was, I was seventeen years old then. [Laughs] That&#039;s right.

KIRLIN: Did you ever work on a sailing ship? Was there sailing ships down there
when you was, uh, first started? Wooden ships?

MOSES: Huh?

KIRLIN: Any wooden ships you worked on?

WILLIAMS: Sailing ships?

MOSES: Oh no, there was seagoers.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah there was seagoers. But the most of them was, didn&#039;t have no
‘tween decks.

KIRLIN: One big hold.

MOSES: The top half and the bottom.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah. Turpentine ships. Yeah.

WILLIAMS: That must’ve been something.

MOSES: Now, they, later years, they got around to different things, you know--
And all of them things that they were doing in them times was, I called it
mankillers, [Laugh] at that time. And if you, and if you wasn&#039;t a good man, you
couldn&#039;t, you couldn’t stand it. That&#039;s right.

KIRLIN: Man killers?

MOSES: That’s right.

KIRLIN: What was that? Can you describe it for us, some of it?

MOSES: Well I, I didn&#039;t fool around there long. It wasn&#039;t too long before I left
and come, come East here.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: See? Yeah, I just, I used to work with, I used to work the cotton mills,
you know where they packed cotton at?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Buckle, I pressed you know, press would be the, uh, up, you know, and
loose the door, drop them down, running tides through that. And somebody on the
other side will run the others through that bring this end up and you, you
buckle it in the center.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And then when you run the buckle up it tightens up. Yeah. And you --

WILLIAMS: Into a big bale?

MOSES: Yeah. Then you roll it down a skid out, out there. Yeah.

KIRLIN: Did you handle bales on the waterfront here?

MOSES: Huh?

KIRLIN: Bales.

MOSES: Oh, no they, they stowed bales like, like, um, on the, on the charm. See
now, this day and time, all of the oil that is shipped has been panelized in
drums, but in those days they were wooden barrels, and, and you had to, you had
to put a bed under there and bear this end down and stick the bed under there.
Then you’d take your knee and you’d raise it and you’d stick the bed under
there, see?

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And then your barrel is solid.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And you move on with the tail right straight on, see? All right, uh. See,
I’ve done all of that.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah. Yeah.

KIRLIN: Well, I guess that’s enough for one day. Huh, Moses?

MOSES: Well, I could tell you enough to write a history.

KIRLIN: That’s what we want.

WILLIAMS: That’s what we want.

KIRLIN: That’s what we want.

MOSES: [Laughs] Yeah. Tell you enough to write a history.

KIRLIN: [Laughs]

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Anything else you remember about the IWW days you want, you want to tell us?

MOSES: Huh?

KIRLIN: Anything else about the IWW that you may want to tell us?

MOSES: No. The, after, after the company got blackballed, that was the end of them.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

KIRLIN: Yeah. But how come they was so strong when they were here?

MOSES: Well, they, I don’t know. Polly, Polly Baker was a big man in it. He
was the head, head kicker of it.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

KIRLIN: What-

MOSES: Polly Baker that, that had this union. Yeah. What-

WILLIAMS: What happened to him?

MOSES: Oh, he died.

WILLIAMS: Hm. I mean, how did

MOSES: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: -but he stayed there until he died? I mean --

MOSES: Yeah. Um-hm. And Cliff Carter, he come on to be the organizer, you know.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: And uh, I don’t know what happened to him. He used to live over there
at Eleventh and Lombard. I think he retired, you know. And Askew, he died, of
course. He was the president of 1291. And Askew come from Atlantic Refinery, the
Marley Steamship Company. And he worked over there on Marley’s clay boats
until later years he made president for 1291.

WILLIAMS: Um-hm.

MOSES: Yeah.

KIRLIN: Dick Askew?

MOSES: Um-hm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they got any ships over there now?

KIRLIN: Uh. I, I, I’ve heard A and G closed-

MOSES: Hm.

KIRLIN: -closed shop. A and G went out of business.

MOSES: [Laughs] Well, I didn’t know.

KIRLIN: I bet you’ve seen a lot of companies go out of business.

MOSES: Huh?



WILLIAMS: You’ve seen a lot of companies go out of business.

MOSES: Oh, yeah.

KIRLIN: Yeah. Yeah.
