mssa_hvt_4401_p1of1 [00:00:23.23] MILTON GILMAN: You start. You start it, don't you? [00:00:25.06] JOANNE RUDOLF: Yeah well, he's going to signal me. My name is Joanne Rudolph. Today is August 7, 2007, and this is the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University. [00:00:40.15] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, my name is Milton Gilman, uh, and-- [00:00:47.38] JOANNE RUDOLF: Where were you born? [00:00:47.92] MILTON GILMAN: I was born in Hartford, Connecticut on August the 2nd, 1918. Anything else you want to know? [00:00:56.24] JOANNE RUDOLF: So you just celebrated your birthday? [00:00:57.97] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, I'm 89 last week. Yeah. [00:00:59.89] JOANNE RUDOLF: [INAUDIBLE] . [00:01:01.14] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, but I'm saddened because I just lost my wife. [00:01:04.22] JOANNE RUDOLF: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. [00:01:05.30] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, a year ago. I'm up here for the unveiling. [00:01:09.73] JOANNE RUDOLF: So if you could tell me a little bit about, just a bit about your background and your entry into the military. [00:01:15.52] MILTON GILMAN: Well my background is-- uh, I was a musician, a saxophone player for many years, from 19-- from the time I was 14 up until 21. And made my made my living by working in G. Fox and Company in Hartford days and playing nights. Then, I was drafted into the service in 1943. 1942, actually, is when I got my first notice. And my daughter was born in November of 1942. Uh, drafted in-- March of '43 is when I went into the service as a private and was sent to Camp Devens. And, and I don't know, so-- through there, and then from there to some camp in New York. [00:02:11.93] And then finally, uh, went with a-- I went as a medical student, or whatever they would call it in those days, to camp Pickett in Virginia, and that's where we picked up some of our medical training because I was, I was not trained medically at all. I was a musician. And oddly enough, that's-- I, uh, when I went into the outfit at Camp Pickett, I found that there were a lot of not-- they weren't really friends, but they were acquaintances that had formed their own orchestra in Pickett. And uh, they asked me to join them, and I did, and it was wonderful. [00:02:58.87] So my basic training in Pickett was really rehearsing with a band, and that eventually turned out to be one of the best bands in the Army. It-- we were selected to go to Washington in 1943 in August and play on the grounds of the Washington Monument, and we camped out at the Hains Point, and used to march back and forth to the showgrounds, which were on the grounds of the Washington Monument. And it, it was quite a show. It was a 60 day-- a 30 day show but extended to 60, and we played for most of the dignitaries, including F. D. R., and Churchill, and-- at least, we were told they were in the audience. And that was wonderful. [00:03:55.93] When we got through with the camp, with the, with the show, we were told that we were going to be transferred to a general hospital. And that was wonderful news because then I could have my wife and my daughter living near me. That did not happen because this guy, one of the fellows in the band, got drunk one night and insulted the, the colonel that was in charge, and that was the end of the band. He disbanded the band, although the band had won many prizes. [00:04:33.46] And we were transferred-- I was transferred to the, to Camp Shelby in uh, in Mississippi, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and there I was put into the Medical Corps, into the medical battalion, as a private. And uh, uh, my training in, in, in, medicine was all done at camp, at Camp Pickett. And from there, uh, a year later we were transferred up to, uh, Brooklyn, New York and took off for, for France. [00:05:15.91] Landed in France in January of '45-- January '45, yes-- uh, and unfortunately, I mean, it, it was a rough landing, the ship that took us over. We had to jump out and wade in, and this was right in the middle of January, and it was ice cold, and wade in. And then we started the camps. We were at Camp Lucky Strike. There were several camps in the, uh, in the area, and these were large. Actually, what they were was large tents, and they laid out the cots in them. And then about-- [00:05:56.13] JOANNE RUDOLF: And they were hospitals? [00:05:57.56] MILTON GILMAN: They, they were not hospitals. They had separate t-tents for hospitals, but we really didn't set up a hospital there. We set up the hospital after we got in line. [00:06:07.48] JOANNE RUDOLF: Mm hmm. [00:06:08.47] MILTON GILMAN: We were there about two weeks, and then were trans-- then we started to motor brocade, and motorcade, and all, all the way up through France and through Germany and into Austria, and the war ended in Austria on May the 7th, 6th or 7th. I don't remember now. All I know is we heard the, uh, the, uh, the end of it because there was no more shoot-- you didn't hear any guns or anything go off. [00:06:40.15] JOANNE RUDOLF: What was your-- [00:06:40.78] MILTON GILMAN: And-- [00:06:41.23] JOANNE RUDOLF: --division? [00:06:41.59] MILTON GILMAN: It was a division, 65th Division, and 365th Medical Battalion-- [00:06:47.46] JOANNE RUDOLF: And were you-- [00:06:47.68] MILTON GILMAN: --which was a part of the-- [00:06:48.38] JOANNE RUDOLF: When you were travelling, were you under combat conditions? [00:06:51.15] MILTON GILMAN: Oh yes, oh yeah, we could hear com-- we were right on the line. Uh, we could hear what was going on, and then our collecting company-- we had four collecting companies in the medical battalion, and they, uh, they were collecting, you know, the wounded and dead up, up the street up, uh, in a line. But we were right in the line. [00:07:19.10] In fact, the night of the, of the, uh, stop shooting thing, I was up on t-- sleeping on top of a bunch of gas cans on a truck, and about 2:00 o'clock in the morning we heard the no, the no fire anymore. So there was-- that war stopped for all practical purposes. That war stopped, and we we, we were a little bit on our own in those days, but part of the division, the b-- especially the 365th Battalion went to-- and this was in Linz, Austria, where the war ended for us. And down just about 16 miles away was the Mathausen Camp. And of course, being Jewish and wanting to see what it was like, we, we snuck a Jeep, a friend of mine, [? Nate ?] [? Shapiro ?] from Middletown and I, and we drove to where the camp was. [00:08:24.55] JOANNE RUDOLF: How did you hear about it? [00:08:27.35] MILTON GILMAN: Through-- I don't know. Through the-- you know, the Germans never knew anything about it, the Austrians. They didn't even know, supposedly, that there was a camp there, but somehow or other we got to know about it. Actually, the night of the ceasefire, I, I, we drove, I drove across the line, and, with German divisions on each side, or Austrian, you know, and, uh, drove up to meet the Russians because that was-- this was on the Danube River, and they were on-- half of the bridge was Russian, were the Russians, and the other half of the bridge across the Danube were the Americans. [00:09:06.73] And so then from there we went to Mauthausen because that was the first night of the, of the ceasefire. We went to Mauthausen, and we were the first in there. [00:09:18.70] JOANNE RUDOLF: What did it mean to you, a concentration camp, before you got there? [00:09:22.87] MILTON GILMAN: I did not know-- we did not know-- the extent of what a concentration camp meant. Uh, we did not know that the, uh, the people were exterminated in the camp. And to this day, I don't know how we found out. But anyway, we, we went in there, and we liberated the camp, took the-- they were-- I have to call them specimens because that's what they looked like. They were rails, and then, you know, they had the striped uniform or striped pajamas or whatever they call them-- and brought them out. And most of them couldn't even walk, and the medical battalion had what they call today a-- where they determine how, how, how sick a-- triage? [00:10:15.26] JOANNE RUDOLF: Triage. [00:10:16.60] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, triage. And we loaded about, about, uh, I would think it was about 500 or 600 into trucks, into GI vehicles and drove to Linz, which was 16 miles away. And in Linz, we found a Austrian hospital that we had already been evacuated. We, we, we had, had an advance party that went there and evacuated them. Oh, I must add, also, that that was the beginning of penicillin, and the Germans and Austrian doctors were begging us for penicillin because we were a medical battalion, and we had it, but I don't think they gave them-- I don't know. I don't know what the workings were inside. [00:11:07.63] But we did bring this group over to the hospital, and by the time we got there, a good half of them were gone. And that was the, the type of thing we were exposed to. [00:11:21.90] JOANNE RUDOLF: Could you describe driving up to the camp, what it looked like to you, and what you encountered inside? [00:11:29.34] MILTON GILMAN: It was a, it was a fenced-in area, and it had-- and what I recall-- a big gate, a big iron gate, and I don't know what it said before we went in. I, I've been there since. I, took my wife-- may she rest in peace-- there to show her where we had gone, and they had-- the fence was still there. The gates were open, of course, and they had writings in German, and in Austrian, and not in, not in Yiddish, unfortunately. And, uh, most of the, most of the houses were torn down, the camp grounds. [00:12:10.29] JOANNE RUDOLF: When you went recently with your wife? [00:12:11.64] MILTON GILMAN: When we went to back, yeah. But when we went there the first time, of course, we, we went through these houses, and we had our own triage, as you call it, and the, and the doctors in the medical battalion were taking the people that they thought were, were capable of going further. It was not pleasant, and, and that's why I have not talked about it too much, but I still say that the 500 or 600-- or it could even be more than that-- that we took down in the vehicles, in the army vehicles and brought them to the, to the hospital-- we had evacuated an Austrian hospital in Linz, and they were brought in right away. But by the time we got to the camp, half of them were gone. You know, they, they, uh, by the time we got to the hospital. [00:13:09.98] It was not, it was not a pretty sight, and it certainly-- and no, no citizen around there that you spoke-- I had, I spoke Yiddish, so I was the interpreter in my outfit because Yiddish and German are so closely related that, that they could understand me, and I could understand them. And, uh, they didn't seem to know that there was a extermination camp 16 miles away. They were ignorant of that, although they said that they used to get the smells. I don't know how they ever did it, but none of none of them were guilty. And, uh, that's it. [00:13:53.22] JOANNE RUDOLF: What did it smell like to you when you entered? [00:13:55.82] MILTON GILMAN: Uh, you know, I don't recall. I don't recall because I don't remember even seeing the, the ovens. Uh, I'm sure I did, but I don't recall it. I recall seeing the, the victims that were brought out and brought into the trucks and how gaunt and terrible they looked. [00:14:20.57] JOANNE RUDOLF: Did you speak with any of them? [00:14:23.07] MILTON GILMAN: I tri-- I don't recall that. You know, this was a long time ago. Uh, I must have. I know I was very upset because there were no Jewish agencies there to take up the [? rap. ?] There was Engli-- there were agencies from England, agencies from France, agencies from, from every other country in the world except Jewish to take up. You know, because this was the place for them to be. It took about two or three weeks for some of the Ameri-- some of the Jewish agencies to come in and take care of these poor people. And that-- what else can I tell you? [00:15:02.22] JOANNE RUDOLF: So when you evacuated these people to the hospital, did you ever go back to Mauthausen from there? [00:15:08.79] MILTON GILMAN: Yes, well I went back for a visit, not, not-- [00:15:11.34] JOANNE RUDOLF: At that time. [00:15:11.85] MILTON GILMAN: Not at that time, no. [00:15:13.50] JOANNE RUDOLF: So it was-- how long do you think you were there? [00:15:16.52] MILTON GILMAN: Oh, I think we were there at 36 hours. [00:15:20.73] JOANNE RUDOLF: In Mauthausen? [00:15:21.49] MILTON GILMAN: In Mauthausen, yeah. I mean, we slept in the trucks, in, in the trucks that we were in, the vehicles we were brought, but I didn't go through the camp minutely. If I did, I don't recall it. I do recall the fact that there were no agencies to take care of the Jewish people, but there were agencies for almost everybody else, and the Russians, the Polish, everybody had an agency. And it, it was a horrible sight, and it was not a, not a pleasant sight to see. [00:15:55.18] And of course, when we got to the hospital in, in Linz, and evacuated what was in there, the doctors in there were begging our doctors in my outfit for-- because penicillin had just come in, and it was a magic, at that time, it was a magic drug because so many of their people were infected with, you know, with not having the medication be able to stop any of the infections. And but we-- I don't think we gave them. I think-- I remember hearing the doctors say, we need them for our own people. [00:16:33.46] JOANNE RUDOLF: Now, when you brought the concentration camp survivors to the hospital in Linz, who was taking care of them in that hospital? [00:16:41.92] MILTON GILMAN: Our own doctors, our own doc-- no, we didn't use theirs that I recall, and, you know, everything is a little bit vague, but, uh. And I don't remember whether Mauthausen was considered a big camp, and I don't think it was considered an extermination camp. It's just that, they were ordered to-- I don't know what their orders were from the Germans, but, uh, it, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a memory now, and I mean, it's just a, a sad memory. [00:17:22.43] I know that I was very disturbed when I went down to the Holocaust Museum in, in Washington and went through it, and came down, and didn't see any notice of, of the 65th Division or the 365 Medical Battalion as being the, uh, the people that liberated Mauthausen. And I called the Army headquarters and was told how I could-- I, I don't know. It's taken over, and around. I couldn't, couldn't get to the proper authorities that could, could make that so. So some other division got the honors for being the liberators of Mauthausen. I remember that, and-- [00:18:13.12] JOANNE RUDOLF: Do you remember other divisions being there? [00:18:15.67] MILTON GILMAN: No, no, no, I think it say-- they said it was the 26th Division, but I don't remember them being there. I only remember the three, the-- not even the division, the 365th Medical Battalion that were the first ones there. [00:18:30.69] JOANNE RUDOLF: So your division basically stayed back in Linz, and just the medical battalion went. [00:18:34.84] MILTON GILMAN: Our division was at the camp ground somewhere near the, near Mauthausen, but not, not quite as far as Linz. Linz was 16 miles. [00:18:43.48] JOANNE RUDOLF: Uh huh. [00:18:43.88] MILTON GILMAN: That I know. And, uh, but we didn't get the credit or the honors of being the liberators of Mauthausen, we-- although, we did liber-- we opened the gates. [00:18:57.97] JOANNE RUDOLF: Now, when you went back to Linz, to this hospital, did you just drop the people off, or did you stay? [00:19:04.40] MILTON GILMAN: We dropped the people off. They, they had enough medical people there working, and I guess they had, must have, taken on some Austrians, because this was Austria, to, you know, to help them, uh, take the victims out of the trucks, and bring them in, and find beds for them. Uh, I, that's about as far as I can remember it. I, I know we went back to division headquarters, and, a day or two afterwards. [00:19:42.03] JOANNE RUDOLF: Do you remember discussing Mauthausen with your colleagues, or writing about Mauthausen to your wife at home? [00:19:48.94] MILTON GILMAN: Well, we had-- you know, we, in my outfit alone, we had four, four [? Shapiros, ?] so we, we had, you know, we had Jewish people, but, but most of them were anti, were, were not Jewish. Most of them were non-Jews. Most of the, the, uh, senior officers, and the-- even the doctors were not. They were from all over the country. The head doctor was a full colonel from au-- from, uh, from Chicago. [00:20:27.76] What was his name? I, I can't-- uh, I didn't, I didn't write any of this down. It's strictly memory, and, and I'm sure that I'm missing a lot of it, or I'm-- I don't think I'm exaggerating it, but I, I know that it's, it's remained with me over the past-- what is it-- 60 years or 70 years. And, uh, and that's why I'm telling the story today. This is the first time I've, I've been asked to do it. I, I told the kids about it in little spurts and spats, and I did take my wife back there to show her the camp, and we had an Austrian guide that knew what we were talking about. [00:21:11.12] We were living at-- yea, that's right. The division had-- we took over, took over a schoolhouse in Linz, and yes, and there was a hospital right across the street from us. And I know that the guys were all going up to the top floor because the German nurses loved to sunbathe, and they sunbathed in the nude, so, ha. That I remember them talking about. That was more important to them than the victims. What else can I tell you? [00:21:43.39] JOANNE RUDOLF: And as I said, at that time do you remember writing home about Mauthausen? [00:21:48.33] MILTON GILMAN: Did I write? I must have. I,I don't remember. [00:21:51.79] JOANNE RUDOLF: But you don't remember? [00:21:52.37] MILTON GILMAN: There were daily letters that were going out to my wife. My daughter was, you know, three and 1/2 years old already then, uh, this one. [00:22:02.77] JOANNE RUDOLF: Mm hmm. [00:22:04.16] MILTON GILMAN: And, uh, no, I, I, I didn't remember anything. I don't remember anything. Nothing stands out. [00:22:12.44] The second trip, I did find the schoolhouse that we were living in, and I did find the hospital across the s-street from it, where we, uh, where the boys were going upstairs to take a look at the sunbathers. It, it was a very dramatic visit, and I don't know if I should have taken my wife or not, but I did want her to see where we were. And took her up through Germany. [00:22:40.41] JOANNE RUDOLF: Now when you say that the memory stays with you, when, when you say that, what do you see inside your head? [00:22:46.82] MILTON GILMAN: Well, I see these victims, the, the, the triage, bringing them into Linz and taking them into the hospital. Now, the hospital was not the one that we were across in the schoolhouse. It was another hospital, but they had to take their German or Austrian wounded out of there and clear it and then bring, bring these poor people out of the camp in there. It was a, it was a touching time. [00:23:16.89] You know, I can remember c-- the next thing that happened was, uh, was-- this was in-- I, I'm trying to see more. War ended in May. Yeah, and I was, we were stand-- we were there, and I went to Jewish services, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur ser-- I was not a religious man, but I went in, in to Linz-- into Salzburg. I'm sorry, into Salzburg and one of the most beautiful theaters I've ever been in in my life. It was the Mozart Theater, and that's where we hel, held the Rosh Hashanah service and the Yom Kippur service, and, uh, the, uh, some of the people from the camps were there, sitting in, in, in the audience. And some were up on the stage, and they held a beautiful service. [00:24:21.35] JOANNE RUDOLF: So this was five months later? [00:24:22.97] MILTON GILMAN: This is five months later. By that time, a lot of-- there was a lot of healing. You know, there was a lot of big difference in, in what had happened when we were there. [00:24:33.86] JOANNE RUDOLF: So you were, in that interim period of time, you were still stationed in Europe. [00:24:38.69] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, we were still stationed in Linz. Yeah. [00:24:40.49] JOANNE RUDOLF: Mm hmm. Did you have any contact with the displaced persons camps? [00:24:44.42] MILTON GILMAN: No. No, I shouldn't say so. I'm sorry. Yes, I did. I was a supply sergeant, and then, and I-- it was my job to supposedly go out and pick up food at the, at the various slaughter houses, and pick up the meat, and part of it, and give it to the German soldiers because there were German soldiers on both sides of the road. And what we would do is we would pick up the, the bread and the, and the meat, and we'd bring it over to the camp where, where the refugees were and give them, give it to the refugees so they would have something to eat before we gave it to Germans. [00:25:29.50] JOANNE RUDOLF: Did you have conversations or contact with the DPs? [00:25:33.28] MILTON GILMAN: I must have. I don't recall, but I, I'm sure I did. I, I, I could, you know, I could un-- they, they would talk in Yiddish, and I would understand it because I did understand and speak it well in those days. Uh, I, you know, the very intimate things I, I can't. I know they were there. They must have been there because I did have feelings, and, uh, and very, very strong feelings, anti, anti-German feelings, and, uh, the Austrians were just as bad, but there was no way of voicing them, or, or doing it. [00:26:16.43] The officers in the battalion didn't seem to-- it didn't seem to affect them, if I remember correctly. They were mostly doctors, a lot of nurses, and a lot of just soldiers, you know, who-- 90-day wonders, we called them, who had gotten through, um, Army, uh, regulations there to become an officer, you know. Yeah, it was not good memories. [00:26:51.38] JOANNE RUDOLF: And when you came home at the end, after your time in the military was over, did you ever discuss it? Early on. [00:26:59.53] MILTON GILMAN: I, I, I didn't. It, you know, I had-- I told the kids. The kids knew about it. My daughter knew almost from the time she could understand. She was only four when I came home, three and 1/2, three and 3/4. I, no, there was no. She was the only one that was always curious. [00:27:21.59] My son didn't. He, he's-- but he wasn't born until after the war, you know, after I came home, and he's a physician, so, but I never really discussed it with him. I did discuss it with-- the only ones I discussed it with was trying to get to the US Army to have the 65th Division, and 365th Medical Battalion, get some of the, some of the honors for, uh, for getting, you know, doing, getting into the camp and, and, uh liberating it. [LAUGHTER] What else can I tell you? [00:28:03.95] JOANNE RUDOLF: Well, if there's anything else that you recall or that you want to share with us. [00:28:08.50] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, I wanted to go home. I couldn't wait to be discharged. This is already seven or eight months later. I mean, this was in, in December and January, December of '45 and January of '46, and I did. I got my discharge notice, and got on a ship in, in February, and came back to the United States, and there I became a human again. [00:28:38.46] JOANNE RUDOLF: Hmm. [00:28:38.92] MILTON GILMAN: [LAUGHTER] [00:28:41.19] JOANNE RUDOLF: Well, we thank you very much for taking the time to come here. [00:28:44.57] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah, I, I don't know of anything else that I could tell you. I don't know if-- I suppose that there are things that I have forgotten or that occurred at that time. I had one friend, a fellow by the name of [? Nate ?] [? Shapiro ?] from Middletown, and he was an ambulance driver, so we were very fortunate that-- I wasn't. I was a supply sergeant, and I, I could drive, and I had my army license, but there was no reason for me to have a Jeep. [00:29:21.47] And when we went over to meet the Russians the day the war ended, I stole a Jeep. I, I, it was in the, it was in the parking lot. It was one of the officer's, and we went over, and we spent-- it was a whole night. We got there about 1:00, 2:00 o'clock in the morning, or 3:00 o'clock in the morning. [00:29:41.21] I don't remember. And they were drinking, and they were drunk, and they were, they were killing the Germans even then. I mean, they were-- you couldn't. You had to, you had to communicate with hand motions because I, they didn't know the language, and I didn't know the language. It's a tough, uh huh, tough deal, but we spent a, a good 24 hours with the Russians then, and then drove back to our outfit. [00:30:13.96] JOANNE RUDOLF: Well, again, I want to thank you for taking the time to come and-- [00:30:17.05] MILTON GILMAN: Oh. [00:30:17.47] JOANNE RUDOLF: --share your memories with us. [00:30:18.27] MILTON GILMAN: You're, you're welcome. I don't know if I've been able to really tell you, you know, what, what went on and how it went on. All I know is the 365th Division, the 365th Medical Battalion were the first ones on the scene-- [00:30:35.89] JOANNE RUDOLF: Mm hmm. [00:30:36.72] MILTON GILMAN: --at Mauthausen. And of course, we didn't know what concentration camps were in those, in that, at that time. We found out quickly. [00:30:47.72] JOANNE RUDOLF: Hmm. [00:30:48.59] MILTON GILMAN: Yeah. And I don't know of anyone who came out of Mauthausen, except [?
