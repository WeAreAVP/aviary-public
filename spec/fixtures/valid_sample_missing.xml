        <partial_transcript_alt></partial_transcript_alt>
        <synopsis>Moses briefly recalls his birth in 1886 and growing up in Alabama before moving to Philadelphia in 1916 at around age 30, his “young prime of life.”  He worked for a contractor building Piers 96 and 98. He recounts working for Trist, stripping bridges and building piers. </synopsis>

        <synopsis>Moses describes the lay offs of high-paid workers from Trist; he rejected the offer of a promotion to general boss that would have required him to relocate to Nova Scotia. He stayed on with Trist to clean up the pier construction. After that work was complete, he headed to the wharf and found a job moving flour at Pier 48, which extended several additional days. The boss saw that he was a hard worker who learned quickly, so he had Moses continue working, becoming as he describes, a “superman.”</synopsis>

        <partial_transcript>And so, they done, one day McNamara and Mr. Dugan come on the ship where I was working, said, &quot;Moses?&quot; &quot;Yes sir, Captain, what is it?&quot; &quot;We are going to make a gang boss out of you.&quot;</partial_transcript>
        <partial_transcript_alt></partial_transcript_alt>
        <synopsis>Dugan and McNamara promoted Moses to gang boss. Moses recalls his reluctance, because he worried that if his new gang did not succeed, he would lose his job, rather than have the steady work he currently relied upon. His bosses thought he could form a gang in several weeks, but Moses promised to do so in ten minutes. Moses recounts organizing the new work gang and proving himself as a gang boss, dealing with a variety of cargo. Moses belonged to the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), which restricted which piers and ships he and his gangs could work.</synopsis>

        <synopsis>Moses emphasizes the lasting relationships he has formed with his coworkers Henry Bolak and Owens. When he saw Henry Bolak 24 years later, Bolak recalled that people still talked about Moses with admiration. Moses recounts a time when Owens gave him a free snow shovel from the company, even though Moses was retired at this point.

        <synopsis>In 1922, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) established a union in Philadelphia,  but the International Workers of the World (IWW) was already in Philadelphia. Moses and ten others were in the ILA and worked for Jarka but they could not tell anyone that they were in the ILA because the IWW was so strong. Many shipping companies “blackballed” the IWW; so Moses and the other ILA members tried to get a local charter but they needed someone to talk to the owner of the Marley Steamship Company.</synopsis>

        <partial_transcript_alt></partial_transcript_alt>
        <synopsis>Moses discusses why the IWW got &quot;blackballed&quot; along the Philadelphia docks.  IWW members would walk off the ship if they did not like the way bosses treated them. Moses recounts how he assigned his workers to various tasks, including delegating the unloading of canned goods to his workers who were literate. Laborers not in his gang often wanted to work for him. </synopsis>

        <synopsis>Moses discusses how all companies hired workers at Piers 53 and 48 under the bridge. He goes into detail about which companies hired there and if there was one that did not, he elaborates on where it hired people. He also states that if a gang was slated to go somewhere, that worker went there and did not go under the bridge to look for work.</synopsis>

    <description>Moses briefly recalls his birth in 1886 and growing up in Alabama before moving to Philadelphia in 1916 at around age 30. He talks about working for various companies on the piers, including Trist and Jarka, and discusses being made a gang boss.



      In 1922, the International Longshoremenâ€™s Association (ILA) established a union in Philadelphia, but the International Workers of the World (IWW) was already in Philadelphia. Moses and ten others were in the ILA and worked for Jarka but they could not tell anyone that they were in the ILA because the IWW was so strong. Many shipping companies â€œblackballedâ€ the IWW; so Moses and the other ILA members tried to get a local charter but they needed someone to talk to the owner of the Marley Steamship Company. Paul â€œPollyâ€ Baker was the president of the local IWW, but when companies &quot;blackballed&quot; the IWW, he went to work for the Atlantic Refinery. Moses and the other ILA members recruited Baker to talk to the Marley Steamship owners and try to get a local charter for the ILA. He was successful in establishing the local ILA charter, number 1116.



      Moses recalls working as a seventeen-year-old stowing rosin on ships, and packing cotton for shipment at cotton mills in Mobile, Alabama. </description>
